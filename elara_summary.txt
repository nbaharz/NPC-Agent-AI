The human asks the AI for information about ancient wars. The AI responds by mentioning a destructive war between kingdoms that occurred about 300 years ago. While details may have been lost over time, the effects are still felt, and traces of the war may be found in tunnels under Silver Keep and possibly in an obelisk in the forest. The AI warns the human to be careful, as the past sometimes prefers to rest in peace.
